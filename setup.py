""" acoustic_gps is a package for sound field reconstruction using 
Gaussian processes.

It provides:

- complex valued Gaussian process regression for sound field 
  reconstruction
- kernels based on both radial basis functions and plane waves 
  expansions
- Bayesian inference of the kernel hyperparameters via pyStan
- sound field visualization tools
- and more

Besides its obvious use for acoustics, the kernels in acoustic_gps can 
be easily adapted for the reconstruction of other fields such as 
electromagnetic.
